# 2D Adventure Game Engine Project

This repository now focuses on the browser-based escape room prototype located in the `prototype/` directory.

## Legacy Materials
Older planning documents and reference data that are not used by the current web game have been archived in the `old/` folder:
- `old/GAME_ENGINE_REPORT.md` – Initial design notes and background on classic adventure game mechanics.
- `old/screen_layouts/` – Directory for storing screenshot references of adventure game screen layouts. See `old/screen_layouts/README.md` for details.

Please note that due to environment limitations, this project does not include actual screenshots. Gather them manually and place them in the `old/screen_layouts` folder if needed.
