# 2D Adventure Game Engine Project

This repository contains planning documents for a retro-style point-and-click adventure game engine.

## Contents
- `GAME_ENGINE_REPORT.md` – Initial design notes and background on classic adventure game mechanics.
- `screen_layouts/` – Directory for storing screenshot references of adventure game screen layouts. See `screen_layouts/README.md` for details.

Please note that due to environment limitations, this project does not include actual screenshots. Gather them manually and place them in the `screen_layouts` folder.
