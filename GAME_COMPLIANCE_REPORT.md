# Game Compliance Review

## Requested Concept Summary
- First-person perspective fantasy adventure inspired by retro titles such as *悪魔の招待状* and *Shadowgate*.
- Player begins reincarnated with commoner-level parameters and uses a system modeled on Call of Cthulhu (CoC) TRPG skills and stats.
- Critical (CCB-equivalent) successes trigger growth checks enabling progression to tackle higher difficulty.
- Death transfers 20% of the previous character's abilities to the next, supporting roguelite-style meta-progression.
- Large, carefully designed world with bespoke dungeons and quests that avoid repetitive, mass-produced content.
- Estimated 5-hour playtime culminating in locating and defeating a Demon Lord whose whereabouts are initially unknown, requiring investigation and exploration.

## Prototype Implementation Summary
- The `prototype/` directory contains a minimal “escape the room” demo rendered in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 【F:prototype/README.md†L1-L13】
- Gameplay is limited to a single static scene (one locked room) with two interactable hotspots: a box and a door. 【F:prototype/main.js†L1-L66】
- Inventory handling consists of toggling a single “Key” item to unlock the door and end the game. 【F:prototype/main.js†L41-L66】

## Compliance Evaluation
| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| First-person perspective adventure inspired by classic titles | ❌ | Current prototype is a flat, single-screen escape room lacking first-person navigation or narrative depth. 【F:prototype/main.js†L1-L66】 |
| Fantasy setting with reincarnated protagonist starting at normal stats | ❌ | No narrative elements or stats are implemented. |
| CoC TRPG-style stats/skills and CCB-based growth checks | ❌ | No character sheet, dice mechanics, or progression systems exist. |
| Critical success growth system leading to high-difficulty challenges | ❌ | There are no skill checks or difficulty scaling. |
| Death inheritance (20% stat carryover) | ❌ | No death state or multi-character progression. |
| Large, non-repetitive world with handcrafted dungeons/quests | ❌ | Only a single room with one puzzle is available. 【F:prototype/main.js†L1-L66】 |
| ~5-hour playtime with Demon Lord end goal discovered via investigation | ❌ | Experience ends immediately after unlocking the door; no overarching quest or Demon Lord. |

## Development Autonomy Assessment
The existing codebase demonstrates only the most basic point-and-click interaction without any of the requested RPG/adventure systems. Substantial systems design, content creation, and engine work would be required to approach the specified scope. At present, the project cannot autonomously progress toward the requested design without a comprehensive rebuild plan covering:
- Narrative framework and world-building.
- Character/stat systems following CoC TRPG conventions.
- Dice mechanics, critical successes, and growth checks.
- Death and inheritance mechanics with persistent meta-progression.
- Exploration structure featuring multiple handcrafted dungeons and quests.
- Long-form content planning to support ~5 hours of play and a Demon Lord objective.

Additional manpower or detailed specifications would be needed before meaningful progress toward the target experience can begin.
