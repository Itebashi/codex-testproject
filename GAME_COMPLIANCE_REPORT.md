# Game Compliance Report

This compliance checklist defines the minimum safety, privacy, and accessibility requirements for the escape room prototype.

## Player Safety and Wellbeing
- Present a concise safety notice before play begins, covering screen time, break reminders, and photosensitivity warnings.
- Require the player to acknowledge age guidance (13+ or guardian supervision) before gameplay starts.
- Provide an always-available help panel that reiterates safety tips and explains how to pause or stop play.

## Privacy and Support
- Display a short privacy statement making it clear that no personal data is collected.
- Provide contact information for reporting issues or requesting support.

## Accessibility Options
- Offer toggles for high-contrast visuals and enlarged text to aid low-vision players.
- Provide a reduced motion mode to minimise animated feedback.
- Ensure screen reader support by using semantic markup and live regions for dynamic text updates.

## In-Game Disclosures
- Include buttons that allow the player to re-open safety, privacy, and support information at any time.
- Track when the player has acknowledged the compliance checklist so the session can be reset if needed.

Developers should verify that all of the above requirements are implemented and tested before shipping any build of the prototype.
