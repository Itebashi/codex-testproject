# Screen Layout References

This folder is intended to store reference images for 2D adventure game screen layouts.

Due to the environment limitations, the repository does not include actual screenshots. To populate this folder, you can manually download images from classic titles such as **Shadowgate** and **Uninvited**.

Suggested steps:
1. Search the web for screenshots of classic 2D adventure games.
2. Save them in this directory using descriptive filenames.
3. Document the source of each image in this README.

Example structure:
```
screen_layouts/
├── shadowgate_room1.png
├── uninvited_hallway.png
└── README.md
```
